your reviews are good and helpful 10/10

NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
=================

nice visualization

some labels cannot be read (blue on blue)

the animation is jittery on roll over: add a delay to overcome that

the animation is also unnecessary since seecting a bubble does not d anything. teh circle around it would be justified if info appeared, to clarify what the info refers to

the zoom is also unnecessary as it does not reveal any details, just hides the details about the rest of the data



NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
==================================
ACoffy
======

this is a tableau like visualization more than a plot

it is a little crowded (remember the rule of 7 elements max) but well organized, so still readable

the legend does not need the title legend

the cardinal pints cloud be indicated more elegantly and simply by 2 arrows 

the data shown is ambiguous and the legend does not help at all: less than 250 what? (crimes presumably but not clear) and what is the difference in what is plotted by points and colored areas?

ManushiM
========

stack histograms are difficult to read: given the few bins side by side histogram would have been a better choice

Others should probably not be the first bin, but the last. otherwise reading left to right the reader does not know other from what

the last label is too long: split into 2 rows


legend way too small

choosing one category to be gray the other one a vivid color give the impression that one is more important or relevant than the other (which may or may not be intended given the context)

thick lines are not neessary and cause ambiguity when thy overlab

the datapoints are sparse: the plot could be compressed on the x axisand this would aid comparison

tick labels are ont he small side, but not terribly small 

color blindeness compliant
